# CA - Cellular Automata Simulator

## Description
This project consists of two main parts: a fire simulation and an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The fire simulation models the spread of fire in a grid, whereas the Game of Life is a cellular automaton simulation where cells live, die, or evolve based on specific rules. Both simulations utilize OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism to demonstrate clean code practices.

## Features
- **Fire Simulation**: Simulates the spreading of fire in different conditions.
- **Game of Life**: Simulates the evolution of cells based on Conway's rules.
- **OOP Practices**: Demonstrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Java JDK is installed on your machine.
3. Compile the Java files in your preferred IDE or from the command line.

```bash
javac FireApp.java GameOfLifeB3App.java
```

## Usage
To run the fire simulation or Game of Life, execute the respective classes after compilation.

```bash
java FireApp
java GameOfLifeB3App
```
